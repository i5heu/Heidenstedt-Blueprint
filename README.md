The following presumptions guide this blueprint's protocol:
1. The measure of effectiveness is in the actions taken, not in the plans made.
2. The approach should be as straightforward as possible.
3. Customization to individual needs and preferences is key for long-term adherence
4. Consistency over intensity: gradual, consistent changes are more sustainable than intense, short-term efforts
5. Accessibility and practicality of activities and dietary choices should be considered to ensure they can be incorporated into daily routines
6. Mental health is as important as physical health; activities and dietary choices should support overall well-being
7. Continuous learning and adaptation are necessary to cater to changing needs and circumstances
8. Feedback and self-monitoring are crucial components for maintaining motivation and tracking progress

## Diet

To ensure the success of the first stage of the protocol, it's important to incorporate these additional key points:

1. The food included in the initial stage should be palatable and appealing to those accustomed to a "normal" diet, though "boring" food is okay.
2. Meal preparation should be straightforward and not time-consuming, recognizing the importance of convenience in daily life.
3. Ingredients should be readily available and not overly exotic or expensive, making the diet practical and sustainable.
4. The diet should offer variety to prevent monotony, catering to a range of taste preferences while maintaining nutritional balance.

### Stage 1

Eat Breakfast and Lunch in a 4h window, and fast for the remaining 20h.

#### Breakfast

##### Ingredients
- Black Lentils: 45 grams dry (~150 grams cooked)
- Broccoli (head+stalk): 250 grams
- Cauliflower: 150 grams
- Shiitake or Maitake Mushrooms: 50 grams
- Garlic: 1 clove
- Ginger Root: 3 grams
- Lime: 1
- Cumin: 1 Tbsp
- Apple Cider Vinegar: 1 Tbsp
- Hemp Seeds: 1 Tbsp
- Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 1 Tbsp (for drizzling)
- 100% Dark Chocolate: 1 Tbsp (optional)
- Creatine: 2.5g (optional)

##### Preparation Instructions
1. **Vegetables**: Weigh and prepare the broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, ginger, and garlic. Boil in water until tender (approximately 7-9 minutes). Steaming is an acceptable alternative. 
   
2. **Lentils**: In a medium saucepan, bring water to boil. Add lentils and cook uncovered on low heat for 18-20 minutes until 'al dente'. Drain and rinse under cold water using a colander.

3. **Blending**: In a high-speed blender, combine 1 Tbsp dried cumin, 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar, the juice of 1 fresh lime, cooked black lentils, and the strained cooked vegetables. Blend until it becomes a thick soup consistency. Add some of the vegetable water if needed to thin the texture.

4. **Final Touches**: Top the dish with hemp seeds. Drizzle with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Optionally, sprinkle with 100% dark chocolate and/or add 2.5g of Creatine.

**Note**: Cook using low temperature, high humidity, high acidity, and high antioxidant methods to minimize the formation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) and Advanced Lipid Peroxidation End-products (ALEs).

> Note: To acidic, high speed blender does not work well, food processor does not result in a smooth texture, cut ingredients small before mixing in blender.
> Note 2: Added spermidine powder, helped with acidity.
